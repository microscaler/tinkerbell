# Tinkerbell ADR Index

This document tracks relevant Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Tinkerbell agentic runtime project. ADRs are numbered sequentially and grouped by functional domain.

## üß† Agent Architecture

- **ADR-0003**: Task Scheduler Model  
  Coroutine-first, cooperative scheduling with stateful yield and resume semantics.

- **ADR-0004**: Agent Loop and ReAct Design  
  Lifecycle of an agent: reasoning, acting, yielding, and interacting with tools.

- **ADR-0005**: Virtual Canvas Git Strategy  
  Strategy for code change tracking, patch application, and micro-commits.

---

## üì¶ Storage & Durability

- **ADR-0006**: WAL Schema and Replay Policy  
  Format of write-ahead log, recovery semantics, and log compaction strategy.

- **ADR-0007**: Process Activity Log (PAL)  
  Real-time activity tracking for agent tasks, complementing the WAL.

- **ADR-0008**: Persistent Agent Memory Strategy  
  Design of Neo4j semantic memory, graph structure, and retrieval policies.
  Emphasize goals, prompts, plan recall, continuity between sessions.


- **ADR-0009**: Code Structure Graph and Symbol Analysis
  graph-based code indexing and semantic AST analysis into
  Neo4j, enabling precise symbol tracking and refactoring intelligence.


- **ADR-0010**: Task Plan Timeline and Execution Metadata
  Structure for task execution metadata, including plan history and decision lineage.

## üîê Runtime & Execution
- **ADR-0013**: Firecracker MicroVM Integration  
  VM lifecycle, execution isolation, resource constraints.

- **ADR-0014**: Command Execution and Safety Policy
