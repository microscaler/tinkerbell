## 🧚 Tinkerbell 🧚 An Autonomous Agentic Development Runtime

<img src="docs/images/tinkerbell.png" alt="Tinkerbell Logo" width="800"/>

**Tinkerbell** is a next-generation, open-source Autonomous Agentic Development system designed from the ground up for sophisticated, scalable, and intelligent software development. 

Tinkerbell significantly advances beyond traditional LLM-based agents (such as Gemini-cli or Claude) by leveraging semantic reasoning, structured memory management, and distributed execution. 

---

## 🚀 Why Tinkerbell?

Current agentic systems, despite handling large token contexts, often struggle with scalability, efficiency, accuracy, and maintainability. Tinkerbell addresses these critical limitations through a carefully designed architecture that provides unmatched precision, auditability, and flexibility.

Unlike conventional large-context LLM agents, Tinkerbell’s groundbreaking approach includes:

* **Structured Semantic Memory** with explicit versioning and temporal drift management.
* **Specialized FAR Agent Clusters** for in-depth and context-aware reasoning.
* **Efficient Virtual Canvas and GitOps-based Micro-Commits** for auditable and structured code evolution.
* **Scalable Kubernetes-driven orchestration** utilizing Flintlock and Firecracker MicroVMs for robust isolation.
* **Intelligent Multi-LLM Routing** to select the optimal model for every task.
* **Comprehensive Observability** via structured logging and detailed Prometheus metrics.

## 🛠️ Core Features and Capabilities

### 🌐 Semantic Graph and Persistent Memory

* Explicitly structured memory using Neo4j graphs and vector embeddings.
* Precise semantic relationships for deep contextual reasoning.
* Temporal versioning and drift handling ensure accurate, current context.

### 🔍 Specialized Skill Clusters (Hexagonal Architecture)

* Coordinated agent clusters specialized by personas (Planning, QA, Security, Docs).
* Enhanced collaboration, reasoning depth, and task precision.

### ⚙️ Virtual Canvas and GitOps Strategy

* Granular, semantic-aware micro-commits for auditability.
* Clear traceability and debugging of agentic decisions.

### 🚦 Kubernetes-based FAR Controller

* Robust orchestration of FAR agents, leveraging Kubernetes' scalability.
* Node-level orchestration via Liquidmetal, with efficient lifecycle handling (sleep, resurrection).

### 🚀 Firecracker MicroVM Integration via Flintlock

* Lightweight, fast, secure VM-based isolation for each FAR agent.
* Predictable performance, strong security isolation, and low resource overhead.

### 🤖 Multi-LLM Routing with GenAI

* Dynamically selects optimal LLMs based on cost, performance, and capabilities.
* Seamless integration with emerging specialized and optimized inference models.

### 📈 Advanced Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Tracing)

* Structured Prometheus metrics, providing deep insight into operations.
* Detailed tracing spans and structured logging with Rust’s `tracing` crate.
