# Tinkerbell Scheduler

The `scheduler` crate implements Tinkerbell’s coroutine-based cooperative task scheduler.

> ✅ This crate is a **minimal MVP** that focuses on building and testing the fundamental task management loop — before any agentic cognition is added.

---

## 🎯 MVP Objective

The scheduler should:

- Support creating and running **multiple tasks** concurrently
- Support yielding, blocking, and resuming tasks cooperatively
- Manage tasks via:
  - FIFO ready queue
  - Per-task LIFO call stack (for nested coroutines)
- Support blocking system calls like `Sleep`, `WaitTask`, `ReadWait`
- Be fully testable via deterministic simulations
- Implement a strict test harness that verifies lifecycle behavior, blocking/wakeup, and call-stack trampolining

## 🌀 Core Concepts

| Concept         | Description                                                   |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Task`          | A generator-style coroutine that can yield system calls       |
| `Scheduler`     | Manages task queue, blocking map, and the main loop           |
| `SystemCall`    | An abstract yield, e.g., `Sleep`, `Spawn`, `Join`, `Log` |
| `ReadyQueue`    | FIFO queue of runnable tasks built on `VecDeque<TaskId>` |
| `CallStack`     | LIFO per-task stack for nested coroutine trampolining |
| `WaitMap`       | Tracks join/wait conditions for resumption |
| `ready_len()`   | Inspect number of tasks currently queued |

---

## 🔍 Example Flow

```rust
let mut sched = Scheduler::new();
let tid = sched.spawn(echo_loop());
sched.run();
````

Inside `echo_loop`, you might yield:

```rust
yield SystemCall::Sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
```

The task is then moved to a timed wait queue, and resumed later by the scheduler.

Tasks automatically yield back to the scheduler after each call to `TaskContext::syscall`,
ensuring cooperative execution across all running tasks.

---

### Scheduler Loop

`Scheduler::run` processes events in a fixed order each iteration:

1. **Drain system calls** – all pending `SystemCall`s are handled first. This may
   wake tasks waiting on joins or I/O and records any completed tasks.
2. **Apply I/O completions** – any ready I/O events are drained and their waiting
   tasks queued.
3. **Pull next task** – a task ID is popped from the ready queue. If the queue is
   empty the scheduler waits up to five seconds for an I/O event before
   returning.

This guarantees that tasks unblocked by system calls resume promptly before the
next ready task is polled.

### 🔮 Coroutine Implementation Guidance

While the initial MVP of the scheduler may use a simple `Box<dyn Generator<Yield = SystemCall, Return = ()>>` model for tasks, contributors are encouraged to evaluate **long-term strategies** based on two possible coroutine models in Rust:

#### 1. ✅ [May](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may) Coroutine Crate

- Mature userland stackful coroutine runtime
- No `Send + Sync` required
- Deterministic, good for local multitasking
- Pros: lightweight, proven, battle-tested
- Cons: Requires external runtime, less idiomatic with `async` ecosystems

#### 2. 🧪 Native Rust 2024 `generators`

- Stabilizing `Generator` trait in `std` as part of coroutine roadmap
- Uses built-in `yield` keyword
- Integrates well with Rust’s future `gen` support and async schedulers
- Pros: native, no external deps, future-proof
- Cons: still under stabilization in parts of the ecosystem

---

### 💡 Guiding Principle

The scheduler crate must:

- Be **agnostic to coroutine engine** (via trait or `dyn Task` abstraction)
- Document internal coroutine usage clearly
- Provide a toggle or feature flag (e.g., `--features native-gen`) if dual support emerges


---

## 🧪 Testing Framework

All tests run **deterministically**. Features under test:


* Task resumption and execution order
* Join dependencies
* Stack-based subcoroutines
* Time-based blocking (`Sleep`)
* I/O wait (`IoWait`)
* Manual signal triggering to unblock tasks

Use:

```bash
cargo test -p scheduler
```

## 🧱 Non-Functional Requirements

| Characteristic | Implementation Strategy                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Deterministic  | Tasks yield values; no threads, no preemption |
| Observable     | All transitions may be traced to logs/PAL     |
| Isolated       | Tasks are logically sandboxed                 |
| Portable       | No OS dependencies; purely Rust coroutines    |
| Replayable     | Future: WAL hook for recording yields         |

### 🛣️ Scheduler Roadmap — Next Milestones

*(moving from “it works” ⇒ “production-ready, PyOS8-inspired”)*

| Phase | Focus Area                    | Why It Matters                                                                                                                        | Concrete Next Tasks                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **True cooperative stepping** | Right now we drive purely from blocking `recv_timeout`. PyOS8 yields back to the scheduler **every time the coroutine uses `yield`**. | • Refactor `TaskContext` to expose an explicit `yield_now()`<br>• Replace `std::thread::sleep` in `SystemCall::Sleep` with inserting a `(wake_at, tid)` into a timed wheel / min-heap. |
| **2** | **TickClock & virtual time**  | Deterministic tests + future timeouts without wall-clock sleeps.                                                                      | • Wire `TickClock` into `Scheduler` (inject during tests).<br>• Create a `sleep_heap: BinaryHeap<(Instant, TaskId)>`.<br>• Add `tick()` path to pop ready sleepers.                    |
| **3** | **I/O poll abstraction**      | Real async runtime needs readiness events (Fd / network).                                                                             | • Introduce trait `IoSource { fn ready(&self) -> u64 }`.<br>• Map `SystemCall::IoWait` to epoll/kqueue (behind feature).                                                               |
| **4** | **Cancellation & timeouts**   | PyOS8 supports cancelling tasks via “kill task id”.                                                                                   | • Add `SystemCall::Cancel(target)`. <br>• Store `cancelled: HashSet<TaskId>` and drop tasks gracefully.                                                                                |
| **5** | **Priority & fairness**       | Some agents (e.g., WAL flusher) must pre-empt heavy compute.                                                                          | • Replace FIFO `ReadyQueue` with (`priority, tid`) binary-heap.<br>• Expose `spawn_with_priority(priority, f)` API.                                                                    |
| **6** | **Error & panic isolation**   | Panicking inside a coroutine shouldn’t crash scheduler.                                                                               | • Wrap `handle.join()` in `catch_unwind`; emit PAL entry.<br>• Bubble failure to any `Join` waiters with an error code.                                                                |
| **7** | **Supervisor tasks**          | PyOS8 supervises children; Tiffany needs same for WAL/PAL.                                                                            | • Add “system” tasks started at boot (metrics flush, GC).                                                                                                                              |
| **8** | **Instrumentation**           | We’ll plug metric spans + event hooks into PAL & Prometheus.                                                                          | • Emit `tracing` span per `run()` cycle.<br>• Counter: `scheduler_ready_queue_depth`.<br>• Histogram: task run-to-completion latency.                                                  |

| PyOS8 Concept                                           | Tiffany Parity               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `yield` returns a syscall tuple                         | our `ctx.syscall(...)`       |
| Scheduler maintains *ready*, *sleeping*, *waiting* maps | already present, will expand |
| `select` loop for I/O readiness                         | planned in Phase 3           |
| Task cancellation via exception injection               | Phase 4                      |
| Timers advancing virtual clock                          | Phase 2                      |

---

With these phases complete, Tiffany’s scheduler moves from **PoC** to a **tiny cooperative micro-kernel** capable of orchestrating thousands of lightweight in-VM tasks deterministically and observably.


---
## 🧩 Future Integrations

Once the scheduler is hardened and verified:

* Add `ReasonAct` agent loop on top
* Connect `executor` for skill invocation
* Begin streaming WAL/PAL logs for tracing

---

## Related Crates

* [`core`](../core) – runtime primitives and ID generators
* [`wal`](../wal) – planned replay integration
* [`daemon`](../daemon) – starts and owns the scheduler lifecycle

---

## 🚀 Goal

This MVP exists to **prove the core scheduler model** is robust and composable.

Until this crate has 100% test coverage on all coroutine lifecycles and blocking behaviors, no agent cognition (`reasonact`) will be integrated.
